sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: In the best cases, this sort function runs very quickly, but slows down in
non-optimal cases. It's hampered by *big O* of n in those cases.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Running time for this sort functions seems to follow a log scale.
Even with larger lists (50000) it seems to sort relatively quickly. On smaller lists
it performs well, but not as it ought to if *big O* was n^2 or n.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Does ok with smaller lists, but slowed down by larger unsorted lists.
Theta of n^2 causes longer run times. The run times are consistently mediocre, compared to
the other sort functions.
