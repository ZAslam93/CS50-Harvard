sort1 uses: Bubble sort

How do you know?: In the best cases, this sort function runs very quickly, but slows down in 
non-optimal cases.

sort2 uses: Merge sort

How do you know?: Running time for this sort functions seems to follow a log scale.
Even with larger lists (50000) it seems to sort relatively quickly, but on smaller lists
it performs well, but not as well as it ought to if theta was n^2 or n.

sort3 uses: Selection sort

How do you know?: Does ok with smaller lists, but really slowed down by larger unsorted lists.
Theta of n^2 causes longer run times.
